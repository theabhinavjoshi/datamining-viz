Overview

This repository houses a comprehensive data mining project that delves into the Books dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project encompasses data analysis, visualization, and the development of interactive tools, including a Streamlit dashboard and a rudimentary item-based recommendation system.
Highlights

    Data Exploration and Analysis: Extracted valuable insights from the Books dataset, including most rated books, top-rated authors, and distribution of user ratings.

    Geographic and Demographic Visualizations: Utilized geographic and demographic analyses to showcase user distribution across countries and age groups, providing nuanced perspectives on user engagement.

    Item-Based Recommendation System: Implemented a recommendation system that suggests books based on item correlations and user ratings, contributing to a personalized user experience.

    Interactive Dashboard with Streamlit: Developed a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard using Streamlit, consolidating visualizations, recommendation systems, and geographic analyses in a centralized hub.

    Learning Experience

This project serves not only as a showcase of insights derived from the Books dataset but also as a learning experience in data preprocessing, visualization, and recommendation systems. The iterative process and collaborative nature of the project contribute to a holistic understanding of data science and its practical applications.
